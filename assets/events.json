These discussions, however, aren’t new to them; many participated in environmental education programs when they were in elementary and secondary school.",

It was a small ask after all. The book was brand new, one I hadn’t catalogued or even stamped with the school’s name yet. It was not ready to be loaned out.",

I just had received several copies of the title in large print so I asked Bobby to switch from reading his regular print to the larger text. I was curious to see if he would notice any difference between the two formats. Bobby obliged and spent the rest of the period quietly reading, but when the bell rang and it was time to return the book that’s when he gave me the look."
